# hello-world

Hi folks,

I am following the GitHub Guides to create master branch and then create another branch called readme-edits from master branch. I am currently editing readme.md file to get familiarity with Commit changes and merging back the changes to master.

Thanks and Appreciate your patience reading this file.

Cheers,
Ashok
